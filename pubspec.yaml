# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to

publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NHL
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/NHLENYRO.ttf

    - family: NHL2
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/NHLEPho_.ttf

    - family: A
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/A.ttf

    - family: F
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/F.ttf
    
    - family: FL
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/FL.ttf
    
    - family: D
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/D.otf
    
    - family: "AD"
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/AD.otf
    
    - family: "M"
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/MS.otf

    - family: "FS"
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/FS.ttf
    
    - family: "CB"
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/CB.otf
